rdmaze.py:  rdmaze program to find solution path in puzzle
			
How to execute the program:
	1. Run rdmaze.py
	2. Heuristic Selection options will be shown as below:
		Heuristic selection: 
		Enter 1 for Manhattahn distance computation
		Enter 2 for Euclidean distance computation
		Enter 3 for computation based on maxmimum of x and y differences
		Please enter 1 or 2 or 3: 
	3. Enter 1, 2 or 3 as per requirement

Interpretations:
	1. The output file shows initial board with source and destination values 
	2. Then it shows following information 
	If solution is available
		For example:		
		No. of nodes put on the frontier:  62 (62 nodes were added on frontier queue)
		No. of nodes visited:  47 (47 nodes were visited)
		No. of moves in solution: 16 
		- 0,0 - 1,0 - 1,1 - 0,1 - 0,0 - 1,0 - 2,0 - 3,0 - 3,1 - 4,1 - 4,2 - 4,3 - 4,4 - 3,4 - 3,3 - 2,3 - 2,4
		(Sequence of moves shown above)
	If solution is not available: 
		For example:
		No. of nodes put on the frontier:  3 (3 nodes were added in frontier)
		No. of nodes visited:  3 (3 nodes were visited)
		No Solution (There is no solution for this puzzle)
	3. If solution is available, for each move till goal node shown in sequence
		a.Updated grid with dice position is displayed using 'D' letter
			e.g. 'D' letter denotes position of Dice
			S . . . . 
			D . * * * 
			. * . . G 
			. . . . . 
			* . . . . 

		b.Updated dice orientation is also shown below
		    e.g. {'back': 3, 'below': 6, 'front': 4, 'right': 2, 'left': 5, 'up': 1}
			Dice has 3 on back side, 4 on front, 2 on right side, 5 on left side, 1 on up side and 6 on below side.
